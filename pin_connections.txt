## COMPONENT WIRING

### BNC Word Clock Outputs
```
Teensy Pin → 75Ω Resistor → BNC Center Pin
                          └─ BNC Shield → GND
```

### Audio Transformer (TY-141P)
```
Audio Board Line Out L → 10µF Cap → Pin 1 (Primary)
Pin 2 (Primary) → GND
Pin 3 (Secondary) → TRS Tip & 10K Pot Wiper
Pin 4 (Secondary) → TRS Ring & 10K Pot End
TRS Sleeve → GND
```

### OLED Display (I2C)
```
OLED Pin | Teensy Pin | Wire Color (suggested)
---------|------------|----------------------
GND      | GND        | Black
VCC      | 3.3V       | Red
SCL      | 19         | Yellow
SDA      | 18         | Blue
```

### Rotary Encoder
```
Encoder Pin | Teensy Pin | Wire Color (suggested)
------------|------------|----------------------
GND         | GND        | Black
+           | 3.3V       | Red
A           | 6          | Green
B           | 7          | White
SW          | 8          | Blue
```

### LEDs
```
LED Color | Teensy Pin | Resistor | Purpose
----------|------------|----------|--------
Green     | 4          | 220Ω     | Power
Yellow    | 5          | 220Ω     | LTC Active
(Cathodes to GND)
```

## GROUNDING SCHEME

Use STAR GROUND configuration:
```
     Teensy GND
          |
    +-----------+
    |  STAR     |
    |  GROUND   |
    |  POINT    |
    +-----------+
     |  |  |  |
     |  |  |  +-- OLED GND
     |  |  +----- Encoder GND
     |  +-------- BNC Shields
     +----------- Audio GND (TRS Sleeve, Transformer)
```

## POWER DISTRIBUTION

```
USB 5V → Teensy VIN
       ↓
Teensy 3.3V Regulator
       ↓
    3.3V Rail → OLED VCC
              → Encoder VCC
              
Total Current: ~200mA typical
```

## CABLE MANAGEMENT TIPS

1. Keep audio cables away from digital signals
2. Use twisted pairs for I2C (SDA/SCL)
3. Keep word clock lines short and direct
4. Route LED wires along enclosure edges
5. Secure USB cable with hot glue

## TEST POINTS

Add test points for troubleshooting:
- TP1: 3.3V (verify power)
- TP2: Word Clock (scope probe)
- TP3: LTC Audio (before transformer)
- TP4: I2C SDA (logic analyzer)
- TP5: I2C SCL (logic analyzer)

## COLOR CODE STANDARD (Suggested)

- RED: Power (3.3V, 5V)
- BLACK: Ground
- YELLOW: Clock signals
- BLUE: Data signals
- GREEN: Control signals
- WHITE: Audio signals

## ASSEMBLY ORDER

1. Install Teensy + Audio Board
2. Wire power connections first
3. Add I2C devices (OLED)
4. Connect encoder
5. Wire LEDs
6. Add word clock outputs
7. Wire audio path last
8. Test each subsystem before closing

## TESTING CHECKLIST

□ Power LED lights when USB connected
□ OLED displays text
□ Encoder changes values on display
□ Word clock present on BNC (scope)
□ LTC audio on TRS jack (headphones)
□ No shorts between power and ground
□ All connections secure
□ Enclosure properly grounded
